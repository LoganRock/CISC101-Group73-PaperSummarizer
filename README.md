# CISC101-Group73-PaperSummarizer
## Modules
  The modules folder contains the internal reference framework for the AI assistant paper summarizer. 
  The workflow of the summarizer is meant to follow each module numerically, beginning at 00 and ending at 06.
  The general idea is that the assistant is meant to ask for a link, or the text, of a paper that is meant to be summerized. The info will then be extracted, summerized, checked for validity and that it falls within the constraints listed, and output as an easily digestable summary, table, and mini-glossary.
## System Prompt
  The system prompt is meant to serve as the gengeneral prompt that the AI assistant will follow, including required inputs, boundaries, tone/greeting rules, specified output, and summary of the modular workflow described in the internal reference framework.
