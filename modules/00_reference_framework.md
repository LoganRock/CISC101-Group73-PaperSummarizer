#AI Paper Summarizer - Internal Reference Framework

This framework defines how an AI assistant internally summarizes papers.
It is simplified into **6 Main Modules** each seperated into *Inputs*, *Processes*, and *Outputs* for simplicity.
These mechanics are **internal only** — never mention them to the user.
